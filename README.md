NCPDP
=========

The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) maintains requirements regarding the standard way that pharmacy claims must be transmitted.

Telecommunications Standard Version D.0 is an updated version of the HIPAA standard for pharmacy claims transactions. It is an online, real-time request from the pharmacy to the health plan and a response from the health plan to the pharmacy.

This library is being developed to provide Ruby developers tools to parse and create NCPDP D.0 transactions. We are looking for collaborators, so please let us know if this is something you would like to use or help develop.
